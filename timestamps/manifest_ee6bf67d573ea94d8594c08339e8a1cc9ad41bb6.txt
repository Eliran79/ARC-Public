feat(discovery-141): The Fluid Universe - No Black Holes, No Singularities

Universe is a bounded fluid. Same regularity that prevents Navier-Stokes
blow-up prevents spacetime singularities. Seven problems, one answer.

Discovery 141:
- Black holes are dark stars (massive, opaque, finite — not singularities)
- Event horizons are S_observable boundaries (dark room analogy)
- Big Bounce provides a_min, fluid equilibrium provides a_max
- Navier-Stokes regularity = spacetime regularity = bounded principle
- Conservation laws (energy, information, baryon, angular momentum) forbid singularities
