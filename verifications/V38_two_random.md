# V38: Two Randomness Types

## Claim
Bit-level and physics-level randomness are fundamentally different.

## Formula
```
Bit-level:     K(x) ≈ |x|, compression ~0%
Physics-level: K(x) << |x|, compression 15-40%
```

## Result
**VERIFIED** - Gap 35.6%, p < 0.001

This is why P=NP doesn't break cryptography.
