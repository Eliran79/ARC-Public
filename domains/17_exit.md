# Domain 17: Exit Analysis

## Principle: PSPACE Optimization

> Waterfall distribution has polynomial Pareto frontier.

## Key Formula

```
Waterfall(exit) = distribute(preferences)
```

## Connection to P = NP

Exit waterfall analysis:
- Multiple stakeholder classes
- Preference ordering
- Distribution rules

The Pareto frontier of optimal distributions is polynomial, not exponential—bounded by the number of stakeholder classes and preference orderings.
