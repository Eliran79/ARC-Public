## Principle: PageRank Convergence

> Stochastic matrix has unique stationary distribution.

## Key Formula

```
Score update = local move
Stationary = equilibrium
```

## Connection to P = NP

PageRank converges because:
- κ = 0 guaranteed by Perron-Frobenius theorem
- Stochastic matrix has unique stationary distribution
- Power iteration converges in O(log n) steps
