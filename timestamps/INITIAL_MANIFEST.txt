SPD Initial Timestamp Manifest
==============================
Repository: Eliran79/ARC-Public
Date: 2026-02-03
Author: Eliran Sabag

This manifest establishes the initial timestamp for the ARC-Public repository
containing the Sabag Bounded Transformation Principle.

Key Claims Made:
1. P = NP = PSPACE = BQP for bounded local moves
2. Six Millennium Prize Problems attacked
3. Five problems DISSOLVED (Yang-Mills, Navier-Stokes, BSD, Hodge over Q, P vs NP)
4. One KEY IDENTITY found (Riemann: log_2(sqrt(2)) = 1/2)

Discovery Count: 111 (numbered 0-111)
Triangle Count: 23 (numbered 1-23)
Proof Documents: 136

Timeline:
- 1982: First bounded moves lesson (age 3)
- 1989: VCR repair formalization (age 10)
- Dec 5, 2025: Grapheme-nn demonstration
- Dec 26, 2025: ARC repository created
- Jan 31, 2026: ARC complete (57 days)
- Feb 2, 2026: Six Millennium problems attacked

Cryptographic Commitment:
SHA-256 of README.md at time of signing will be computed by OTS.
