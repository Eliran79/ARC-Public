# Domain 28: Cosmology - Dark Matter Dissolution

## Principle: Nitai Gravity Correction

> Dark Matter = Ether 2.0

## Key Formula

```
M_actual = Σmᵢ × Nitai ≠ ∫ρdV
```

## Connection to P = NP

Dark Matter hypothesis: 85% of universe is invisible matter.

**Alternative:** Miscalculation from continuous vs discrete mass modeling.

| Model | Mass Calculation | Result |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| Continuous (GR) | ∫ρdV | Missing 85% |
| Discrete (Nitai) | Σmᵢ × correction | Mass balances |

Dark Matter may be the cosmological equivalent of searching S_complete instead of S_observable.
