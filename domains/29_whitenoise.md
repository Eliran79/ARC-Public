# Domain 29: White Noise Information Theory

## Principle: Bounded Sampling Principle

> Bounded space-time → structured signal → computable universe.

## Key Formula

```
א^א = incomputable (true white noise)
Bounded = P (physical signals)
```

## Connection to P = NP

True white noise (infinite, uncorrelated) is incomputable.

But the universe is:
- Finite in extent
- Bounded in time
- Structured by physics

Therefore all physical signals are in P, not א^א.
