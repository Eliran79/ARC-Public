feat(discovery-123): Add Human Cell Boundedness

Discovery 123 bridges Eukaryotes (121) and Human Body (122):
- ~200-400 cell types (gene regulatory attractors)
- 4-5 cell cycle phases (CDK-checkpoint gates)
- 5-100 μm cell size (SA/V + diffusion limits)
- ~7,000-10,000 membrane proteins (ER synthesis capacity)
- ~400 ion channels (selectivity filter geometry)
- ~2,000 receptors (lock-and-key precision)
- ~15-20 signaling pathways (decision capacity)
- ~50-100 metabolic pathways (enzyme/cofactor pools)
- ~200-1,000 expression states (attractor basins)
- ~95 division limit (Hayflick telomere physics)

All 10 parts verified by verify_human_cells.rs
