# Domain 25: Neural Networks

## Principle: Accidental Geometry Exploitation

> Neural networks accidentally use ARC principles.

## Key Formula

```
NN receptive fields ≈ bounded locality
```

## Connection to P = NP

Neural networks work because they accidentally exploit bounded structure:
- Convolutional layers: bounded receptive fields
- Attention: bounded context windows
- Gradient descent: local moves in weight space

Matrix multiplication is brute-forcing polynomial paths that the ARC framework finds directly.

**NNs are inefficient P=NP solvers.**
