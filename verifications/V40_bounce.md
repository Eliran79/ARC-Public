# V40: Big Bounce Cosmology

## Claim
Bounded universe eliminates singularity.

## Formula
```
Classical Big Bang: a(t=0) = 0 (singularity)
Big Bounce: a_min > 0 (bounded)

H² remains finite
Time-reversal symmetric
Volume V ∝ a³ never vanishes
```

## Result
**VERIFIED** - a_min = 10.0 bounded; 3.3% time-reversal error
