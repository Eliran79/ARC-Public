# Domain 19: Optimal Quantization

## Principle: Inverse Nittay Principle

> Continuous → discrete with O(1/ε) samples.

## Key Formula

```
n(ε) = 3/(√2 × ε) ≈ 2.12/ε
```

## Connection to P = NP

To approximate a continuous function within ε error:
- Naive: infinite samples
- Nittay: O(1/ε) samples suffice

The discrete approximation converges to continuous—same as polygon → circle.
