# Domain 15: Equity Finance

## Principle: Game Equilibrium

> Term sheet negotiation has polynomial Nash equilibria.

## Key Formula

```
Nash(F, I) = argmax utility
```

## Connection to P = NP

Startup funding negotiation:
- Finite players (founders, investors)
- Bounded moves (term changes)
- Polynomial equilibrium space

The negotiation doesn't search all possible term sheets—it traverses S_observable via bounded modifications.
