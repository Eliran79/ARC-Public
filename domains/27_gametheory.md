# Domain 27: Game Theory Strategy

## Principle: D with C in Reserve

> Misdirection + Escalation Path

## Key Formula

```
p(independent discovery) ≈ 5% at 18 months
```

## Connection to P = NP

Strategic considerations for P=NP discovery:
- Matrix multiplication industrial complex provides moat
- Independent discovery probability increases over time
- MAD strategy: release publicly before asymmetric advantage

This domain documents the game-theoretic reasoning behind public release.
