# Domain 16: Valuation (409A)

## Principle: Constraint Satisfaction

> Fair Market Value via bounded constraint search.

## Key Formula

```
FMV = satisfy(IRS_rules)
```

## Connection to P = NP

409A valuation requires satisfying multiple constraints:
- Comparable company analysis
- Discounted cash flow
- Option pricing model

These methods **converge** via bounded constraint satisfaction—not exponential search through all possible valuations.
