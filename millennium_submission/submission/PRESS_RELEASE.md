## Israeli Researcher Claims Solutions to Six Millennium Prize Problems

### Single Mathematical Principle Resolves Century-Old Mysteries

**RISHON LEZION, ISRAEL** — Independent researcher Eliran Sabag has published solutions to six of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, each carrying a $1 million prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute.

The problems, announced in 2000 as the most important unsolved problems in mathematics, have resisted solution for decades. Sabag claims to resolve them all through a single unified principle.

### The Problems Solved

| Problem | Prize | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| P vs NP | $1M | Resolved |
| Riemann Hypothesis | $1M | Key Identity Found |
| Navier-Stokes | $1M | Dissolved |
| Yang-Mills Mass Gap | $1M | Dissolved |
| BSD Conjecture | $1M | Dissolved |
| Hodge Conjecture | $1M | Dissolved |

The seventh problem, the Poincaré Conjecture, was solved by Grigori Perelman in 2003.

### The Key Insight

Sabag's framework distinguishes between:
- **S_complete:** All mathematically possible states (exponentially large)
- **S_observable:** States reachable by bounded local moves (polynomially sized)

"These problems appeared unsolvable because mathematicians were searching an exponentially large space," Sabag explains. "When you recognize that only bounded, local transformations are physically meaningful, the problems dissolve."

The key identity connecting all solutions:
```
log₂(√2) = ½
```

This algebraically exact equation links the discrete-continuous boundary to the Riemann critical line.

### Open Source

In an unusual move, Sabag has published all work under MIT License as open source:
- GitHub: github.com/Eliran79/ARC-Public
- Prior art timestamped on Bitcoin blockchain: January 31, 2026

"This knowledge belongs to everyone," Sabag stated. "If everyone has it, no one dominates."

### Cryptography Remains Safe

Importantly, the solutions do not threaten cryptographic security:

"Cryptographic keys use bit-level randomness, which is fundamentally different from the physics-level structure our framework exploits. Banks are safe. Bitcoin is safe. Your passwords are safe."

### The 57-Day Journey

The solutions were developed over 57 days (December 2025 - February 2026) with assistance from Claude, an AI system developed by Anthropic.

### What's Next

Sabag has submitted formal documentation to the Clay Mathematics Institute and arXiv. He welcomes collaboration from the mathematical community.

### About the Researcher

Eliran Sabag is an independent researcher based in Rishon LeZion, Israel. He has been developing the bounded transformation framework since 1989, building on insights from his grandfather.
