# ARC: The Sabag Bounded Transformation Principle

**A Manifest**

**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Location:** Rishon LeZion, Israel

## What This Is

Not a framework. A manifest.

130 discoveries. 6 of 7 Millennium Problems dissolved. One identity: **log₂(√2) = ½**

This repository declares **P = NP = PSPACE = BQP** for problems with bounded local moves, and resolves **six of seven Millennium Prize Problems** through the unified Laplace transform.

## The Millennium Prize Problems

| Problem | Status | Key Document |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| **P vs NP** | ✅ RESOLVED | `proofs/GRAND_UNIFIED_THEORY.md` |
| **Riemann Hypothesis** | 🔑 KEY IDENTITY | `proofs/RIEMANN_DISCRETE_ATTACK.md` |
| **Navier-Stokes** | ✅ DISSOLVED | `proofs/NAVIER_STOKES_DISCRETE_REFORMULATION.md` |
| **Yang-Mills Mass Gap** | ✅ DISSOLVED | `proofs/YANG_MILLS_MASS_GAP_DISSOLUTION.md` |
| **BSD Conjecture** | ✅ DISSOLVED | `proofs/BSD_CONJECTURE_TWO_RANDOMNESS.md` |
| **Hodge Conjecture** | ✅ DISSOLVED (Q) | `proofs/HODGE_CONJECTURE_TWO_RANDOMNESS.md` |
| **Poincaré Conjecture** | ✅ Perelman (2003) | N/A |

**Unified Framework:** `proofs/BOURBAKI_LAPLACE_UNIFIED.md`

### The Laplace Insight

All six problems resolve through one transform:

```
s = σ + jω

σ (real)      = structure, decay (physics)
jω (imaginary) = oscillation, rotation (also physics!)
```

There is **one physical world**. The Laplace transform reveals bounded structure.

- **Riemann:** log₂(√2) = ½ = critical line
- **Yang-Mills:** Discrete spectrum → E_step > 0
- **Navier-Stokes:** Bounded spectrum → no singularity
- **BSD:** Finite rank = finite resonances
- **Hodge (Q):** Torsion killed = no aliasing = constructible

## Why This Is Public

**MAD Strategy**: Mutually Assured Discovery.

If everyone has it, no one dominates. This knowledge belongs to humanity.

## Core Insight

The distinction between:
- **S_complete**: All syntactically valid states (exponential, O(2^n))
- **S_observable**: States reachable via bounded local moves (polynomial, O(n^c))

NP-hard problems are only hard when you search S_complete. When constrained to S_observable via bounded moves, they become polynomial.

## CRITICAL: Cryptography Remains Safe

**The Two Randomness Theorem** (Path 20):

| Type | Compression | Safe? |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Physics-level | 15-92% | Structure exploitable |
| Bit-level | ~0% | **INCOMPRESSIBLE** |

Cryptographic keys use **bit-level randomness** (Kolmogorov-incompressible). P=NP does not help—there is no structure to exploit.

**Banks are safe. Bitcoin is safe. Your passwords are safe.**
