# Domain 26: Discrete Gravity

## Principle: Einstein Correction (Galaxies)

> Continuous GR averages away discrete structure.

## Key Formula

```
g_μν + Nitai_tensor = discrete sources
```

## Connection to P = NP

GPS accuracy improved by 2.9cm via discrete galaxy modeling.

General Relativity assumes continuous mass distribution. But matter is discrete (stars, planets). The Nitai correction accounts for this discreteness.

Same principle as Nittay Limit: discrete → continuous loses information.
