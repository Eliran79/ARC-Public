# Domain 41: Sparse Optimization

## Principle: Coreset/Pruning Hypothesis

> O(n^c) optima → O(log n) representatives?

## Key Formula

```
HYPOTHESIS: Sparse sampling preserves optimality
```

## Connection to P = NP

**UNEXPLORED DIRECTION**

If O(n^c) local optima exist, can we:
- Sample O(log n) representatives?
- Preserve (1+ε)-optimality?
- Use coresets, sketching, spectral methods?

This could further reduce polynomial to near-linear.

## Status

Open research direction. See: `proofs/DISCOVERY_90_SPARSE_DIRECTION.md`
