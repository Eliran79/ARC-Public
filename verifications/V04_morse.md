# V4: Topological Morse Theory

## Path
Path 6 - Morse Critical Points

## Claim
Optimization landscape has polynomial critical points.

## Formula
```
#(critical points) ≤ Σ βᵢ (Betti numbers)

For bounded-move landscapes:
βᵢ = O(poly(n))
```

## Mathematical Basis
Morse theory bounds critical points by topology. Bounded-move spaces have polynomial Betti numbers → polynomial optima.

## Result
**VERIFIED** - Polynomial critical points for all tested landscapes
