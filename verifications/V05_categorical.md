# V5: Categorical Universal Properties

## Path
Path 7 - Category Theory

## Claim
Terminal objects exist in bounded-move categories.

## Formula
```
∃! morphism: X → T for all X (terminal object T)

For Perm_d (bounded displacement permutations):
Terminal = identity permutation
```

## Mathematical Basis
Categories with bounded morphisms have universal properties. The identity is terminal because all bounded-move sequences can reach it.

## Result
**VERIFIED** - Terminal objects exist in all tested categories
