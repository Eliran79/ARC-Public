# Domain 22: API Security

## Principle: Veil Principle

> Hide methodology, return result only.

## Key Formula

```
Response = {position + accuracy}
```

## Connection to P = NP

The Veil protects polynomial algorithms:
- TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)
- Rate limiting
- Pattern detection

Clients see results, not methods. The polynomial algorithm remains protected while providing value.
