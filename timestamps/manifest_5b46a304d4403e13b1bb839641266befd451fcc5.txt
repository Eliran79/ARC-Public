feat(discovery-121): Add Eukaryotes Boundedness

Discovery 121: Eukaryotes Boundedness Principle
- 3 domains of life (nuclear envelope phase transition)
- ~10 organelles (energy overhead limit)
- Exactly 2 symbiogenesis events (meiotic complexity)
- 5-6 supergroups (molecular phylogenetic clusters)
- 4-5 mitotic phases (CDK-checkpoint equilibria)
- ~200-400 cell types (gene regulatory attractors)
- 2n optimal ploidy (even-odd segregation rule)
