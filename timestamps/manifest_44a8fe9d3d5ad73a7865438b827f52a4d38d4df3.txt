docs: Add Big Bounce cosmology to top-level index documents

Big Bounce, Redshift Artifact, and Discrete Hilbert Space were
documented in proofs/ and verifications/ but never referenced from
README.md, MASTER_INDEX.md, or THE_PATH.md — making them invisible
to tools like NotebookLM that index from entry-point documents.

- README.md: Add 3 cosmology rows to Key Results table + directory listing
- MASTER_INDEX.md: Add Cosmology section with discovery table, document
  links, Theorem T51, Quick Start entry, and Search by Topic entries
- THE_PATH.md: Add Big Bounce to "The Point" section
