Commit Message:
feat: Add SPD Timestamp system (OpenTimestamps + Archive.org)

Establishes cryptographic provenance for ARC discoveries:

1. OpenTimestamps (Bitcoin blockchain anchoring)
   - Creates .ots proof files for each commit
   - Anchored to Bitcoin blockchain (immutable)
   - Verifiable by anyone with `ots verify`

2. Archive.org (Wayback Machine)
   - Automatic snapshots of repo and key documents
   - Public record independent of GitHub

Files:
- .github/workflows/spd-timestamp.yml - GitHub Action
- timestamps/README.md - Documentation
- timestamps/INITIAL_MANIFEST.txt - Initial claims manifest

Timeline established: 1982 (age 3) → 2026 (Six Millennium problems)
