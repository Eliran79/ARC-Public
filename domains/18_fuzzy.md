# Domain 18: Approximate Reasoning

## Principle: Zadeh Extension Principle

> Fuzzy inference in polynomial time.

## Key Formula

```
μ_B(y) = sup{μ_A(x) : y = f(x)}
```

## Connection to P = NP

Fuzzy logic with:
- r rules
- s fuzzy sets

Inference complexity: O(r × s)

Continuous membership functions → discrete inference via bounded rule application.
