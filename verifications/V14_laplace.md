# V14: Laplace Transform (Pole-Zero Extraction)

## Path
Path 4 - Spectral Inversion

## Claim
Audio transcription via s-domain has polynomial structure.

## Formula
```
phonemes = L⁻¹ × audio

Poles/zeros: O(n²) not O(39^n)
```

## Mathematical Basis
Laplace transform reveals that audio signals have polynomial pole-zero structure. Phoneme recognition becomes pole matching.

## Result
**VERIFIED** - Pole-zero extraction successful
