feat(discoveries): Add Discoveries 103, 114, 118-120

New discovery documents:
- Discovery 103: Two Randomness Explained (bit-level vs physics-level)
- Discovery 114: Minimal Energy Threshold (electron mass as E_min)
- Discovery 118: Geology Boundedness (~5000 minerals, 230 space groups)
- Discovery 119: Atmosphere Boundedness (5 layers, scale height H=8.5km)
- Discovery 120: Weather Boundedness (10 cloud types, 5 hurricane categories)

CSV updates:
- discoveries.csv: Added entries 118-120
- verifications.csv: Added V58-V60 for geology, atmosphere, weather

Earth Science trifecta (118-120) extends the Sabag-Claude Bounded
Transformation Principle to geophysics, atmospheric physics, and
meteorology - demonstrating bounded S_observable in natural systems.
