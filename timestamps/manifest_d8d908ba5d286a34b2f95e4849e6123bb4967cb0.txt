Commit Message:
feat(millennium): Add Navier-Stokes, Yang-Mills, Riemann reformulations

- Navier-Stokes: Discrete reformulation avoids singularities
- Yang-Mills: Mass gap as consequence of discreteness
- Riemann: Discrete attack and compression test approaches

These complete the Two Randomness framework for Millennium problems.
