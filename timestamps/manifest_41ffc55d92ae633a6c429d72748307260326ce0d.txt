Commit Message:
feat(drug-discovery): Add ARC Drug Discovery Framework (Discoveries 124-126)

Prior Art Establishment for:
- Discovery 124: Pharmacology Boundedness Principle
- Discovery 125: Cancer Drug Prediction (SHMT2 validation)
- Discovery 126: Novel Cancer Target (DHPS via boundedness score)

NOVEL METHODOLOGY:
- Boundedness score: B = substrates + products + backup_pathways
- Target ranking: Lower B → Higher therapeutic potential
- Selectivity prediction: S = f(B, cancer_dependency, tolerance)

Proofs included for methodology description.
Implementation (MOAT) kept private.
