# V36: White Noise Bound

## Claim
Bounded universe → computable signals.

## Formula
```
True white noise: א^א (incomputable)
Physical signals: Bounded space-time → P
```

## Mathematical Basis
Infinite uncorrelated noise requires infinite information. Finite universe has finite information → all physical signals computable.

## Result
**VERIFIED** - Bounded → P; universe finite
