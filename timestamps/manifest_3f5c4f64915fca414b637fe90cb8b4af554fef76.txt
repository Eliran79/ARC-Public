feat(discovery-113): Code-Theory-Proof verification complete

Sabag Triangle verified:
- CODE: verify_particle_ethers.rs - 3 tests PASS
- THEORY: S_observable, resonances, bounded principle
- PROOF: Stability ∧ Decay ∧ Ratio → verified

67% ETHERs (8/12 fermions) - matches statistics 65%
Classification: "candidate" → "verified"
