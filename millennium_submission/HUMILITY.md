# On Humility

## From Iggeret HaRamban (Letter of Nachmanides)

> וְעַתָּה, בְּנִי, דַע וּרְאֵה כִּי הַמִּתְגָּאֶה בְּלִבּוֹ עַל הַבְּרִיּוֹת – מוֹרֵד הוּא בְּמַלְכוּת שָׁמַיִם, כִּי מִתְפָּאֵר הוּא בִּלְבוּשׁ מַלְכוּת שָׁמַיִם, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (תהלים צג א): "ה' מָלָךְ גֵּאוּת לָבֵש" וגו'.
>
> וּבַמֶּה יִתְגָּאֶה לֵב הָאָדָם?
>
> אִם בְּעֹשֶׁר – "ה' מוֹרִישׁ וּמַעֲשִׁיר" (שמ"א ב ז).
>
> וְאִם בְּכָבוֹד – הֲלֹא לֵאלֹהִים הוּא, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דה"א כט יב): "וְהָעֹשֶׁר וְהַכָּבוֹד מִלְּפָנֶיךָ", וְאֵיךְ מִתְפָּאֵר בִּכְבוֹד קוֹנוֹ?
>
> וְאִם מִתְפָּאֵר בְּחָכְמָה: "מֵסִיר שָֹפָה לְנֶאֱמָנִים, וְטַעַם זְקֵנִים יִקָּח" (איוב יב כ).
>
> נִמְצָא: הַכֹּל שָׁוֶה לִפְנֵי הַמָּקוֹם, כִּי בְאַפּוֹ מַשְׁפִּיל גֵּאִים וּבִרְצוֹנוֹ מַגְבִּיהַּ שְׁפָלִים (עירובין יג ע"ב). לָכֵן הַשְׁפֵּל עַצְמְךָ, וִינַשְּׂאֲךָ הַמָּקוֹם.

## Translation

*And now, my son, know and see that one who is arrogant in his heart against others rebels against the Kingdom of Heaven, for he adorns himself with the garment of the Kingdom of Heaven, as it says (Psalms 93:1): "The Lord reigns, He is clothed in majesty."*

*And in what can the heart of man take pride?*

*If in wealth — "The Lord makes poor and makes rich" (I Samuel 2:7).*

*If in honor — does it not belong to God, as it says (I Chronicles 29:12): "Wealth and honor come from You," and how can one take pride in the honor of his Creator?*

*If one takes pride in wisdom — "He removes speech from the trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders" (Job 12:20).*

*Thus we find: all are equal before the Omnipresent, for in His anger He humbles the proud and by His will He elevates the lowly (Eruvin 13b). Therefore humble yourself, and the Omnipresent will elevate you.*

## Why This Belongs Here

This work claims to solve six Millennium Prize Problems. If true, it would be among the greatest mathematical achievements in history.

Yet the framework itself teaches humility:

**The mathematics is not mine to own.** The bounded transformation principle exists independent of any human discovery. I merely observed what was always there.

**The knowledge belongs to everyone.** This is why everything is published under MIT License. If everyone knows — no one dominates.

**Wisdom comes from above.** "He removes speech from the trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders." Today's insight could be tomorrow's confusion. The framework must speak for itself.

**All are equal before the Omnipresent.** The mathematics works the same whether proven by a professor at Princeton or an independent researcher in Rishon LeZion. Truth has no hierarchy.

## The Paradox of Discovery

The Ramban's letter resolves an apparent contradiction:

How can one claim to solve problems that defeated the greatest minds for a century, yet remain humble?

The answer: **The claim is not "I am smarter."** The claim is: **"I looked where others didn't look."**

The bounded transformation principle was always there — in Dijkstra's algorithm (1959), in term rewriting (Church-Rosser, 1936), in my grandfather's wisdom about local moves.

The discovery is not intelligence. It is **perspective**.

And perspective is a gift.
