## Project Exploration

The ARC-Public project presents the **Sabag Bounded Transformation Principle**, claiming to:

### Main Claims

- **P = NP = PSPACE = BQP** through bounded local moves
- Resolution of **6 of 7 Millennium Prize Problems**
- 141 discoveries across mathematics, physics, biology, and computer science
- 23 independent paths to proving P=NP

### Core Concept

- Distinguishes between S_complete (exponential space) and S_observable (polynomial reachable space)
- Claims that with c-bounded local moves, NP-hard problems become polynomial
- The "Nittay Limit": σ(n)/n → √2, connecting to Riemann's critical line via log₂(√2) = ½

### Supporting Evidence

- 159+ formal proof documents
- Rust verification binaries
- 42 domain validations
- Practical applications (sorting, drug targets, ML)
- Guard8.ai products built on the framework

### Millennium Prize Problems Addressed

From the millennium submission package:

| Problem | Status | Key Insight |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **P vs NP** | ✅ RESOLVED | S_observable << S_complete |
| **Riemann Hypothesis** | 🔑 KEY IDENTITY | log₂(√2) = ½ = critical line |
| **Navier-Stokes** | ✅ DISSOLVED | Bounded particles can't create singularities |
| **Yang-Mills Mass Gap** | ✅ DISSOLVED | Discrete E_step > 0 by definition |
| **BSD Conjecture** | ✅ DISSOLVED | Laplace Completeness forces finite structure |
| **Hodge Conjecture** | ✅ DISSOLVED (Q) | Bounded Q-space forces complete span |

### Key Theoretical Frameworks

**The Observable Sample Space Lemma** (Foundation):
- For any optimization problem with complete space S_complete and c-bounded local moves
- Observable local optima satisfy: |LO_observable| = O(n^g(c)) where g(c) is polynomial
- Proof strategy uses Triangle Axiom, Circulant Structure, Bounded Spectrum

**Laplace Completeness Theorem** (Discovery 109):
- Bounded Laplace systems cannot contain Kolmogorov-incompressible substructure
- Consequence: Bounded systems are "complete" — they cannot hide incompressible structure

**Two Randomness Theorem** (Discovery 103, Path 20):
- Distinguishes bit-level randomness (incompressible) from physics-level randomness (compressible)
- Resolves the "crypto paradox": P=NP can be true theoretically while cryptography remains safe practically
- Physical processes have bounded structure; cryptographic keys do not

### Additional Claims

- No Big Bang (Big Bounce at a_min = 10.0 Planck scale)
- No black hole singularities
- Dark matter is artifact of miscalculation
- 65% of standard model particles are "ethers"
- 26/40 standard probability distributions need correction
- Moore's Law ended at Nittay boundary (16nm = 151 atoms)
- 141 discoveries across physics, biology, chemistry, geology, AI

## Prior Art Search Results

### Critical Finding: NO PRIOR ART FOUND

Extensive web searches were conducted for:
1. "Sabag Bounded Transformation Principle P=NP PSPACE BQP complexity theory"
2. "bounded local moves" complexity theory P vs NP

### Results

- ❌ **No references** to "Sabag" or "Sabag Bounded Transformation Principle" in complexity theory literature
- ❌ **No established framework** for "bounded local moves" as described in this project
- ✅ Only **general P vs NP resources** from established academics (Cook, Aaronson, Wigderson)
- ✅ Some tangential work on **motion planning with bounds** (different context)

### What This Means

- This appears to be **unpublished/unreviewed work** with no academic presence
- No preprints on arXiv, IACR, or other repositories
- No citations in academic databases
- The concepts and terminology are **not recognized** in the computational complexity community
- The repository was only made public on January 31, 2026 (16 days ago)
- First project development began December 26, 2025 (52 days ago)

## Conclusion

The ARC-Public project represents a comprehensive and ambitious theoretical framework developed over 52 days of intensive work (December 26, 2025 - February 15, 2026), building on the author's 35-year journey of converging insights. The project makes extraordinary claims about solving major open problems in mathematics and physics.

As of February 16, 2026, there is no independent verification, peer review, or academic recognition of the work. The repository received one fork during its brief public period (February 5, 2026) before being returned to private status.

The framework, terminology, and concepts are novel and do not appear in existing academic literature on complexity theory, though the author has submitted formal packages to major journals (Nature, Science, Annals of Mathematics) and the Clay Mathematics Institute.
