# Domain 36: Matching Theory

## Principle: Hungarian Algorithm Foundation

> Bipartite matching has κ = 0.

## Key Formula

```
Augmenting path on bipartite = κ = 0
```

## Connection to P = NP

Bipartite matching has exactly 1 optimum because:
- No odd cycles
- Augmenting paths always improve
- Convergence guaranteed

**Hungarian IS Dijkstra for matching.**
