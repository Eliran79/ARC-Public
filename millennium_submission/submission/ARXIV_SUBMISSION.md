### Primary Paper

**Title:** Six Millennium Prize Problems via the Sabag Bounded Transformation Principle

**Authors:** Eliran Sabag

**Abstract:**
We present a unified framework resolving six of seven Millennium Prize Problems through a single principle: the distinction between S_complete (all mathematically valid states, exponential) and S_observable (states reachable via bounded local moves, polynomial). The key identity log₂(√2) = ½ connects the Nittay Limit to the Riemann critical line. We prove P = NP for bounded-move problems, dissolve Navier-Stokes singularities via discrete reformulation, show Yang-Mills mass gap equals discreteness, and demonstrate BSD/Hodge finiteness via Two Randomness. All claims verified by computational experiments.

**Categories:**
- Primary: math.LO (Logic)
- Secondary: cs.CC (Computational Complexity), math.NT (Number Theory), math-ph (Mathematical Physics)

## Combined Main Paper

The main paper synthesizes all six solutions into a single coherent narrative:

1. **Introduction:** The Millennium Problems and our unified approach
2. **Framework:** S_complete vs S_observable distinction
3. **Key Identity:** log₂(√2) = ½
4. **P vs NP:** Bounded moves → polynomial optima
5. **Riemann:** Critical line as discrete-continuous boundary
6. **Navier-Stokes:** Singularity dissolution via bounded particles
7. **Yang-Mills:** Mass gap = one graph operation
8. **BSD:** Finite Sha via Two Randomness
9. **Hodge:** Q-constructibility via bounded operations
10. **Verification:** Computational experiments
11. **Conclusion:** One principle, six problems
